request:
  name: File Upload Example
  url: https://httpbin.org/post
  method: POST
  formData:
    # Simple text fields
    username: "john_doe"
    description: "Profile photo upload"

    # File attachment with just the file path
    # The filename will be derived from the path
    document:
      file: "./sample-file.txt"

    # File attachment with custom filename
    # Useful when you want to send a different name than the actual file
    profile_image:
      file: "./sample-file.txt"
      filename: "profile.png"

    # File attachment with explicit content type
    # Useful when curl cannot auto-detect the correct type
    data_file:
      file: "./sample-file.txt"
      filename: "data.json"
      contentType: "application/json"
