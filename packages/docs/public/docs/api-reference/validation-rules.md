# Validation Rules API Reference

Complete reference for response validation using the expect configuration object. Define validation rules for status codes, headers, and response body content.

## Overview

Validation rules allow you to verify that API responses meet expected criteria. Using the `expect` configuration object, you can validate HTTP status codes, response headers, and body content with support for exact matching, pattern matching, and wildcard validation.

**expect-config-complete.yaml**

```yaml
# Complete ExpectConfig Example
request:
  name: "Comprehensive Validation Example"
  url: "https://api.example.com/users/123"
  method: GET
  expect:
    # Failure expectation (optional - for negative testing)
    failure: false    # false = expect success (default), true = expect failure
    
    # Status code validation
    status: 200
    
    # Response headers validation
    headers:
      content-type: "application/json"
      x-api-version: "v2"
      cache-control: "no-cache, no-store"
      etag: "^W/\\"[a-f0-9]+\\""  # Regex pattern for ETag
      
    # Response body validation
    body:
      id: 123
      username: "johndoe"
      email: "john@example.com"
      profile:
        firstName: "John"
        lastName: "Doe"
        createdAt: "^\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}T\\d{2}:\\d{2}:\\d{2}Z$"  # ISO date
        active: true
        roles: ["user", "premium"]  # Array with specific values
        metadata:
          lastLogin: "*"  # Any value (wildcard)
          preferences: "*"  # Any object structure
```

## ExpectConfig Properties

## Status Code Validation

Validate that responses return expected HTTP status codes. You can specify a single status code or an array of acceptable codes.

**status-validation.yaml**

```yaml
# Status Code Validation Examples

# Single status code (most common)
request:
  name: "Expect Success"
  url: "https://api.example.com/data"
  expect:
    status: 200

---

# Multiple acceptable status codes
request:
  name: "Accept Multiple Status"
  url: "https://api.example.com/users/123"
  method: GET
  expect:
    status: [200, 304]  # OK or Not Modified

---

# Different scenarios
requests:
  # Successful creation
  - name: "Create Resource"
    url: "https://api.example.com/resources"
    method: POST
    body:
      name: "New Resource"
    expect:
      status: 201  # Created
      
  # Successful deletion
  - name: "Delete Resource"
    url: "https://api.example.com/resources/123"
    method: DELETE
    expect:
      status: 204  # No Content
      
  # Conditional request
  - name: "Conditional Get"
    url: "https://api.example.com/data"
    method: GET
    headers:
      If-None-Match: "some-etag"
    expect:
      status: [200, 304]  # OK or Not Modified
      
  # Error handling
  - name: "Expected Not Found"
    url: "https://api.example.com/users/nonexistent"
    method: GET
    expect:
      status: 404  # Not Found is expected
      
  # Rate limiting tolerance
  - name: "Rate Limited Request"
    url: "https://api.example.com/limited-endpoint"
    method: GET
    expect:
      status: [200, 429]  # OK or Too Many Requests
```

## Failure Testing (Negative Testing)

Use `expect.failure: true` to test that endpoints correctly fail in expected ways. This is useful for testing error handling, authentication failures, validation errors, and other scenarios where you expect the request to return a 4xx or 5xx status code.

> **✅ Success:** `expect.failure: true` + 4xx/5xx status + validations pass
> **❌ Failed:** `expect.failure: true` + 2xx/3xx status (expected failure but got success)
> **❌ Failed:** `expect.failure: true` + 4xx/5xx status + validations fail (wrong error details)

**failure-testing.yaml**

```yaml
# Failure Testing Examples

# Test authentication failure
request:
  name: "Test Invalid Authentication"
  url: "https://api.example.com/protected-resource"
  method: GET
  auth:
    type: bearer
    token: "invalid-token"
  expect:
    failure: true    # Expect this request to fail
    status: 401      # Should return Unauthorized
    body:
      error: "Invalid token"
      code: "AUTH_ERROR"

---

# Test validation failure
request:
  name: "Test Invalid Input"
  url: "https://api.example.com/users"
  method: POST
  body:
    name: ""         # Invalid: empty name
    email: "invalid" # Invalid: malformed email
  expect:
    failure: true    # Expect validation to fail
    status: 400      # Should return Bad Request
    body:
      error: "Validation failed"
      details:

    failure: true    # Expect resource not found
    status: 404      # Should return Not Found
    body:
      error: "User not found"
      
---

# Test rate limiting
request:
  name: "Test Rate Limit Exceeded"  
  url: "https://api.example.com/limited-endpoint"

    status: 429      # Should return Too Many Requests
    headers:
      retry-after: "*"  # Should include retry information
      
---

# Mixed success and failure testing
requests:
  # Normal success case
  - name: "Valid Request"
    url: "https://api.example.com/data"
    method: GET
    expect:
      status: 200    # Normal success expectation
      
  # Test failure case  
  - name: "Invalid Request"
    url: "https://api.example.com/data"
    method: GET
    headers:
      authorization: "invalid"
    expect:
      failure: true  # Expect this to fail
      status: 403    # Should be Forbidden
```

## Header Validation

          price: "^[0-9]+\\.[0-9]{2}$"
          category: "^(electronics|clothing|books|home)$"
```

## Wildcard and Flexible Validation

Use wildcards (`*`) to validate field presence without checking specific values, useful for dynamic or sensitive data.

**wildcard-validation.yaml**

```yaml
# Wildcard and Flexible Validation

# Wildcard matching (any value present)
request:
  name: "Wildcard Validation"
  url: "https://api.example.com/user/session"
  expect:
    body:
      user_id: "*"        # Any user ID value
      session_token: "*"  # Any token value
      expires_at: "*"     # Any expiration time
      created_at: "*"     # Any creation time
      
---

# Conditional validation based on response
request:
  name: "Conditional Validation"
  url: "https://api.example.com/user/123"
  expect:
    body:
      id: 123
      username: "johndoe"
      # Premium users have additional fields
      account_type: ["free", "premium", "enterprise"]
      # These fields only present for premium/enterprise
      subscription_id: "*"  # Present if premium/enterprise
      billing_cycle: "*"   # Present if premium/enterprise
      
---

# Nested wildcard validation
request:
  name: "Nested Wildcard"
  url: "https://api.example.com/complex-data"
  expect:
    body:
      metadata:
        created_by: "*"    # Any user info
        tags: "*"          # Any tag structure
        custom_fields: "*" # Any custom field object
      data:
        # Specific validation for critical fields
        id: "^[0-9]+$"
        status: "active"
        # Flexible for other fields
        properties: "*"
        
---

# Array with wildcard elements
request:
  name: "Array Wildcard Elements"
  url: "https://api.example.com/notifications"
  expect:
    body:
      notifications:
        - id: "*"          # Any notification ID
          type: "info"     # Specific type
          message: "*"     # Any message content
          timestamp: "*"   # Any timestamp
        - id: "*"
          type: "*"        # Any type for second notification
          message: "*"
          timestamp: "*"
```

## Validation Inheritance and Overrides

Understand how validation rules cascade from global to collection to request level, and how to override inherited rules.

### Validation Precedence Order

**validation-inheritance.yaml**

```yaml
# Validation Inheritance and Overrides

# Global validation defaults
global:
  defaults:
    expect:
      # All requests expect JSON by default
      headers:
        content-type: "application/json"
      # All requests should be fast
      status: [200, 201, 204]

collection:
  name: "API Test Suite"
  
  # Collection-level validation defaults
  defaults:
