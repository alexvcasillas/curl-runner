# Tutorials

Step-by-step guides to master curl-runner from basics to advanced use cases.

## Available Tutorials

### [Getting Started: Your First API Test](/docs/tutorials/getting-started)

Learn the basics of curl-runner by creating your first API test. This tutorial covers creating YAML files, running requests, and validating responses.

### [Authentication Workflows with Response Storage](/docs/tutorials/authentication-workflows)

Build authentication flows that extract tokens from login responses and use them in subsequent requests. Master response storage for chaining API calls.

### [CI/CD Integration with GitHub Actions](/docs/tutorials/ci-cd-integration)

Set up curl-runner in your CI/CD pipeline. Configure exit codes, failure thresholds, and integrate with GitHub Actions for automated API testing.

### [Performance Testing with Parallel Execution](/docs/tutorials/parallel-execution)

Speed up your test suites by running requests in parallel. Learn when to use parallel vs sequential execution and how to configure performance thresholds.

### [Advanced Validation Patterns](/docs/tutorials/advanced-validation)

Master complex validation techniques including regex patterns, numeric ranges, array selectors, wildcards, and negative testing scenarios.
